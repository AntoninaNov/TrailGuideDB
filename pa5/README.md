## Introduction
This folder includes a SQL script for creating a view that integrates trail data with location details, difficulty levels, and average ratings, facilitating straightforward queries and comprehensive reports.

## Folder Structure
- `views.sql`: Contains SQL statements to create a view that consolidates multiple aspects of trail information.

## Requirements
- MySQL Server (Version 5.7 or newer)
- A SQL client such as MySQL Workbench or phpMyAdmin

## Files Description

### `views.sql`
- **Purpose:** Demonstrates the creation of a SQL view that integrates detailed trail information with location, difficulty, and ratings to provide a comprehensive snapshot of each trail.
- **Features:**
  - Combines data from the `trails`, `locations`, `difficulties`, and `ratings` tables.
  - Simplifies complex joins and calculations into a single, queryable view.
  - Enhances data accessibility and reporting efficiency.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Database Preparation:** Ensure MySQL Server is installed and your database is properly configured.
2. **View Creation:** Execute `views.sql` to create the view in your database.

## How to Run the Script
1. **Execute the View Creation Script:** Open your SQL client, load `views.sql`, and run it to create the `trail_details` view.
2. **Query the View:** Use simple SELECT statements like `SELECT * FROM trail_details;` to fetch comprehensive trail data easily.

## Expected Results
- **View Creation:** The `trail_details` view will be successfully created, combining essential data elements across multiple tables.
- **Simplified Reporting:** You can quickly access and report on detailed trail information through the view without complex SQL queries.
