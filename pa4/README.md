## Introduction
This folder includes SQL scripts focused on creating and executing stored procedures that integrate complex parameter handling, transaction management, and conditional logic to ensure data integrity and procedural functionality.

## Folder Structure
- `procedures.sql`: Contains the definitions of stored procedures with various parameter types and transaction controls.
- `executions.sql`: Demonstrates the execution of these procedures and their effects on data management.

## Requirements
- MySQL Server (Version 5.7 or newer)
- A SQL client such as MySQL Workbench or phpMyAdmin capable of handling stored procedures and transactions.

## Files Description

### `procedures.sql`
- **Purpose:** Defines several stored procedures showcasing the use of IN, OUT, and INOUT parameters along with transactional control mechanisms to handle different data manipulation scenarios effectively.
- **Key Procedures:**
  - `proc_calculate_difficulty_stats`: Calculates the number of trails for a given difficulty.
  - `proc_update_trail_length`: Safely updates trail lengths using a temporary table.
  - `proc_manage_review`: Manages review submissions with transactional logic based on content length.

### `executions.sql`
- **Purpose:** Executes the stored procedures defined in `procedures.sql` and illustrates their real-world application in managing database transactions.
- **Features:**
  - Safe updates of trail lengths.
  - Conditional commits in review management based on review content length.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Database Preparation:** Ensure MySQL Server is installed and the database is accessible.
2. **Procedure Deployment:** Execute `procedures.sql` to deploy the stored procedures into your database.

## How to Run the Scripts
1. **Execute Stored Procedures:** Use `executions.sql` in your SQL client. This script will run the procedures and provide output that demonstrates the proceduresâ€™ effects and transaction outcomes.

## Expected Results
- **Stored Procedures Execution:** You'll observe the implementation of advanced SQL techniques, including parameter passing and transaction control within stored procedures.
- **Transactional Management:** Successful demonstration of conditional logic affecting transaction outcomes, providing a robust mechanism for error handling and data integrity.
